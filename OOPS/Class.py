# Class -> It is a Blueprint (How an object will behave).
# Object -> It is an instance of a class.

# It consists of two things :

#    1. Data or properties or Description about the object
#    2. Functions or Behavior ot Methods

# Example :-

# class Car:  #name of class should be in pascal format.
#     color = "blue"  # Data
#     model = "sports" # Data
#     def calculate_Avg_Speed(km, time): # name of function should be in snake format
#         # Some code here
        
# C1 = Car(56, 7) # this is an Object.
# print(C1.color)  # Accessing data using dot operator
    
# Functions v/s Methods :-

# --->> Methods are functions which are written inside a class. 
# Functions --> Can be accessed by anyone. Methods --> Can be accessed inside a class only.
