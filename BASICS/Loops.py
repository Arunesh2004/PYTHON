i = 1 # This is initialization, this means the loop will start from 1.
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1  # This loop will start from 0 and will run till it reaches 5. It will print the numbers from 1 to 5.
    
    # i = i + 1 --> This is the increment statement. It is used to increment the value of i by 1 in each iteration.
    
# Examples of While Loop with pattern Printing :-

j = 1
while j <= 5:
    print("*" * j)
    j = j + 1
    
print(" ")

k = 5
while k >= 0:
    print("*" * k)
    k = k - 1
